# LARQL Roadmap

Top-level plan of record. Per-crate specifics live in
`crates/<crate>/ROADMAP.md`; this file tracks user-visible features,
the demo narrative, and cross-crate work.

## Current state

- **490 tests passing** across 14 suites, 0 build warnings.
- **Primary CLI verbs** in place: `run`, `chat`, `pull`, `list`, `show`,
  `rm`, `link`, `serve`. Legacy research commands under `larql dev
  <subcmd>` with argv trampoline for backwards-compat.
- **Dual cache** (HuggingFace hub + `~/.cache/larql/local/`) with
  shorthand resolution (`larql run gemma3-4b-it-vindex …`).
- **Remote FFN path (Phase 0 — dense):** `POST /v1/walk-ffn`
  `full_output: true` returns hidden-size output vectors per layer;
  `RemoteWalkBackend` in `larql-inference` drops into `predict_with_ffn`
  unchanged; `larql run --ffn URL` + `larql serve --ffn-only` wire it
  end-to-end. gRPC mirror also landed.
- **Vindex size reductions:** `--compact` (drops
  `up_weights.bin`/`down_weights.bin`), `--drop-gate-vectors` (rebuilds
  gate from `interleaved_q4k.bin` at load), `--quant q4k` implies f16
  on side-channel tensors. Combined: a new 31B q4k extract is **~22 GB
  vs 52 GB before** (~60% smaller).

## P0 — Act 2 of the demo: "The experts live elsewhere"

### Phase 1 — MoE inference path (blocks Act 2)

The whole Act 2 story is MoE-distributed.

- [x] **Gemma 4 MoE architecture hooks** in
  `crates/larql-models/src/architectures/gemma4.rs` — `is_hybrid_moe`,
  `num_experts`, `num_experts_per_token`, `moe_router_key`,
  `packed_experts_gate_up_key`, `packed_experts_down_key`, per-layer
  norms (`pre_feedforward_layernorm_2`, `post_feedforward_layernorm_2`),
  `moe_router_per_expert_scale_key`, `layer_scalar_key`.
- [x] **CPU MoE forward pass** (`crates/larql-compute/src/cpu/ops/moe.rs`):
  BF16 expert dequant, router softmax, top-K selection, per-expert
  gated FFN (gate_proj + up_proj + SiLU + down_proj), weighted sum,
  post-experts RMSNorm. Wired into `decode_token` via GPU/CPU interleave.
- [x] **Metal decode with CPU MoE interleave** — GPU runs dense FFN per
  layer, CPU reads `h_post_attn` (unified memory), runs MoE, adds
  output to `new_h`. Layer scalar correctly applied only to the
  combined FFN+MoE delta (`h_post_attn + scalar * (dense + moe)`),
  not to the full residual.
- [x] **Gemma 4 26B A4B coherent output** — first confirmed working
  Metal inference: "The capital of France is" → "Paris", Germany →
  "Berlin", "hydrogen and" → "oxygen". (2026-04-20)
- [ ] **Batched MoE prefill** — current MoE prefill uses token-by-token
  `decode_token` calls (correct, but O(seq_len) serial GPU dispatches
  per layer). Replace with a batched prefill that processes all prompt
  positions in one pass, interleaving GPU dense FFN and CPU MoE at each
  layer. See `crates/larql-compute/src/metal/trait_impl.rs::prefill_q4`
  and `full_pipeline.rs::dispatch_full_pipeline`.
- [ ] **Fix `dispatch_full_pipeline` layer_scalar** — currently scales
  the full residual including `h_post_attn` instead of only the FFN
  delta. Not hit for Gemma 4 26B (all-MoE bypasses this path) but
  wrong for future non-MoE models with `layer_scalar`. Fix: scale
  `normed_ffn` or `down_out` before the residual add in
  `crates/larql-compute/src/metal/stages/residual.rs::encode_post_ffn`.
- [ ] **MoE-aware forward pass on CPU path** — `predict_q4k` /
  `WeightFfn::forward` has no MoE. The non-Metal CPU path produces
  wrong output on Gemma 4 26B. Wire `cpu_moe_forward` into
  `larql-inference/src/forward/layer.rs`.
- [ ] Wire `RouterIndex` (already exists at
  `crates/larql-vindex/src/index/router.rs`) into the client-side
  forward pass so the router runs locally.

### Phase 2 — Remote expert protocol (Act 2 wire format)

- [ ] `POST /v1/expert/{layer}/{expert_id}` — input residual, output
  residual delta (hidden-size).
- [ ] `POST /v1/expert/batch` — list of `{layer, expert_id, residual}`,
  returns list of deltas. Collapses a layer's K experts into one HTTP
  round trip per server.
- [ ] `--experts 0-31` flag on `larql serve` — load + serve a subset
  of expert IDs so experts can be sharded across machines.
- [ ] `RemoteExpertBackend` in `larql-inference` — MoE-path analog of
  `RemoteWalkBackend`. Handles the sharding map (expert ID range →
  URL), parallel per-layer dispatch, per-expert error handling.

### Phase 3 — LQL / CLI ergonomics

- [ ] `USE "..." WALK ONLY WITH EXPERTS REMOTE { "range": "url", ... };`
  grammar. Extend `crates/larql-lql/src/parser/lifecycle.rs` + executor.
- [ ] `RESHARD EXPERTS { ... };` statement for live redistribution
  (for the "kill one shard, rewire on the fly" proof shot).
- [ ] `larql run --experts '0-31=URL1,32-63=URL2'` CLI flag (MoE
  counterpart to `--ffn`).

### Phase 4 — Data prep

- [ ] `larql slice <vindex> --parts attn,embed,norms,router,index,tokenizer`
  (new subcommand) — carve an attention-only / router-only vindex out
  of a full one without re-extracting from the source model.

### Phase 5 — Deferred until film

- [ ] GPU attention on the client side. `run_attention_block_gpu`
  already exists in `crates/larql-inference/src/attention/gpu.rs` but
  isn't the default path in `forward/layer.rs`. Wire Metal/CUDA into
  the walk-only forward pass so client-side attention runs on GPU
  while FFN/experts go remote.

---

## P1 — Generation UX (chat template, sampling, stopping)

The current `larql run` output loops ("ParisatthecapitalofFranceis...") because
three standard inference features are missing. All are independent and any one
improves the experience.

### Chat template
**Status**: Not started
**Impact**: High — instruction-tuned models (Gemma 3/4 IT, Mistral-Instruct)
loop or produce garbage without their expected prompt format.

`larql run` sends raw text to the model. IT models expect a structured
turn format, e.g. Gemma 4:
```
<start_of_turn>user
The capital of France is<end_of_turn>
<start_of_turn>model
```
Without it, the model sees a bare continuation task and loops greedily.

Fix: read `tokenizer_config.json` from the vindex (already present for
HF-extracted models — lives next to `config.json`). Parse the
`chat_template` Jinja field. Apply it in `larql run` before tokenising.
`minijinja` crate is the standard Rust choice. `larql chat` should always
apply the template; `larql run` can expose `--no-chat-template` for raw use.

### EOS detection and stop strings
**Status**: Partial — `generate.rs` checks for `<eos>`, `</s>`,
`<|endoftext|>` but Gemma 4 uses `<end_of_turn>` which is not in that list.
**Impact**: High — without EOS stopping, greedy decode runs to `--max-tokens`.

Fix: read `eos_token_id` (and `eos_token_ids` list) from `config.json`;
also read `stop_strings` from `generation_config.json` (Gemma 4 lists
`<end_of_turn>` there). Check decoded token string + token ID at every
step in `generate.rs`. `run_cmd.rs` could expose `--stop STRING` for
overrides.

### Token spacing / detokenisation display
**Status**: Not started
**Impact**: Medium — "Paris at the capital..." prints as "Parisatthecapital".

HuggingFace tokenizers use a leading-space convention (`▁Paris`) — the
`tokenizers` crate's `decode` already handles this when
`skip_special_tokens = true`. The bug is likely that `tokenizer.decode`
is called per-token with `false` (keeps `▁` prefix stripped) instead of
accumulating and decoding the full sequence, or that `trim()` is stripping
the leading space. Fix in `generate.rs` decode loop: `decode(&[tid], false)`
and keep the raw string; only trim the very first token.

### Sampling (temperature / top-p / top-k)
**Status**: Not started
**Impact**: Medium for quality, needed for non-deterministic output.

Current path is always greedy (argmax). Add `--temperature F`, `--top-p F`,
`--top-k N` flags to `run_cmd.rs`. Sampling happens after the lm_head
scores are computed in `generate.rs` — no GPU changes required.

### Repetition penalty
**Status**: Not started
**Impact**: Medium — practical fix for the greedy looping problem without
requiring a full chat template. Useful for raw-prompt (`larql run`) and
base models where no chat template exists.

Add `--repetition-penalty F` (default 1.0 = off). Before argmax / sampling,
divide each token's logit by the penalty if that token appears in the
recently generated window. Standard implementation: logit ÷ penalty for
tokens in the last N generated positions. No GPU changes required — purely
a logits post-processing step in `generate.rs`.

### Multi-turn conversation state
**Status**: Not started — `larql chat` resets KV cache per turn today.
**Impact**: High — "chat" implies the model remembers what it said. Without
this, each line in chat mode is an independent cold-start forward pass.

Fix: maintain a running `token_ids` buffer across turns in `run_cmd.rs`.
After each model response, append the response token IDs to the buffer
before the next user turn. Wrap each turn pair in the chat template
(`<start_of_turn>user … model …`) incrementally. Pass the full buffer
to `generate()` so the KV cache grows across turns. Expose `--max-context N`
to bound memory (evict oldest turns when the context window fills).

### Token streaming

### Long context / dynamic KV cache
**Status**: Hard-capped at 4096 tokens today.
**Impact**: High — Gemma 4's headline feature is 1M context. 4096 is a
non-starter for long conversations and the demo's "database" framing.

Two parts:
1. **Configurable max** — expose `--max-context N` (default 8192).
   `KVCache::new_per_layer` already takes `max_seq`; thread `N` through
   `prefill_q4` / `decode_token` call sites in `generate.rs`.
2. **Dynamic growth** — when `current_len` reaches `max_seq`, either
   evict the oldest window (sliding, already implemented as
   `--kv-cache markov-bounded`) or double the buffer. The Metal KV
   cache buffers are pre-allocated; growth requires a realloc + copy on
   the GPU side. A simpler interim: warn and truncate at `max_seq`,
   document as a known limit.
**Status**: Not started
**Impact**: High for UX — without streaming, the CLI is silent until all
`--max-tokens` are done. A 64-token run on Gemma 4 26B takes ~10s with no
output; streaming makes it feel interactive immediately.

Fix: `generate.rs` currently collects tokens into a `Vec` and returns.
Change to accept a `on_token: impl FnMut(&str, f64)` callback (or a
`std::sync::mpsc::Sender`). In `run_cmd.rs`, the callback prints each token
to stdout and flushes. The `larql serve` OpenAI-compatible path (`/v1/chat/completions`
with `stream: true`) would use SSE chunks from the same callback.
Chat mode in `run_cmd.rs` already flushes stdout per turn — streaming
just moves the flush inside the generate loop.

### OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions`
**Status**: Not started — `larql serve` has custom endpoints but no
OpenAI-compatible chat surface.
**Impact**: High for adoption — makes LARQL a drop-in backend for
Continue.dev, Open WebUI, LiteLLM, and any tool that speaks the
OpenAI API. The "you can do this too" demo moment needs a working URL.

With chat template + streaming landing, this is largely wiring:
- `POST /v1/chat/completions` — accept `{model, messages, stream,
  temperature, max_tokens}`, apply the model's chat template to the
  `messages` array, call `generate()`, return `ChatCompletionResponse`
  (non-stream) or SSE `data: {"choices":[{"delta":...}]}` chunks (stream).
- `GET /v1/models` — return the loaded vindex name so clients can
  enumerate available models.
- Wire into `larql-server/src/routes/` alongside the existing endpoints.

### Auto-extract on `larql run hf://`
**Status**: Not started.
**Impact**: High for adoption — the current flow is `larql extract` →
`larql link` → `larql run`. Three commands before inference starts.
The "you can do this too" moment needs one.

Fix: in `cache::resolve_model`, if the shorthand looks like `hf://owner/name`
and no cached vindex matches, offer to run `larql extract` inline
(with a confirmation prompt or `--yes` flag). Download the safetensors
from HuggingFace, stream-extract to a temp directory, move to the
local cache, then proceed with inference. Re-uses the existing
`larql extract` pipeline — the new code is only in the cache resolver
and a progress display wrapper.

### Gemma 3 4B regression smoke test
**Status**: Not started — no CI check verifies correctness after
compute / inference changes.
**Impact**: Medium — after the MoE and layer_scalar changes, nothing
formally verifies Gemma 3 4B still produces "Paris" at expected
probability. One bad merge could silently break the most-used model.

Fix: add a `tests/integration/` test (or `larql-cli` example) that
loads `gemma3-4b-q4k-streaming` (already in the local cache), runs
`larql run "The capital of France is" -n 1 --metal`, and asserts the
first token is "Paris". Gate on `CI_INTEGRATION=1` so it doesn't run
on every PR but does run before release branches.

## P1 — Autoregressive generation quality

### CPU KV cache for autoregressive generation — **SHIPPED**

Two-phase autoregressive decoder in `larql-inference/src/forward/kv_generate.rs`:

- **Prefill** uses `run_attention_with_kv` to capture post-RoPE K and
  post-V-norm V per layer into a `KvCache`.
- **Decode** step in `crates/larql-inference/src/attention/decode.rs`:
  `run_attention_block_decode_step` takes the new token's hidden +
  the layer's existing cache, computes Q/K/V for just that row with
  `apply_rope_partial_at(position=cached_len)`, concatenates the new
  K/V onto the cache, runs `gqa_attention_decode_step` (O(cached_len)
  per head), returns updated cache.

Backend-agnostic via `FfnBackend` — works with `WalkFfn` (local) and
`RemoteWalkBackend` (FFN over HTTP). Measured on Gemma 3 4B f32:

- **Local, no cache (before):** ~1.2 s per decode step, O(N²) growing
- **Local, KV-cached (now):** ~0.6 s/token steady
- **Remote FFN, KV-cached (now):** ~0.5-0.6 s/token steady — same
  protocol as the no-cache version, just many fewer tokens re-shipped

Limitations:
- Skips Gemma 4 E2B per-layer embeddings (PLE) and layer-scalar
  application in the decode loop. Fine for Gemma 3. For full
  Gemma 4 correctness wire `apply_per_layer_embedding` + `apply_layer_scalar`
  into `generate_cached`'s decode layer.
- Q4K CPU path still uses its own no-cache loop (`run_q4k_generate_cpu`).
  Q4K + Metal shader `generate()` remains the fast Q4K path.

### KV cache strategy selector — **SHIPPED (partial)**

`larql run --kv-cache <strategy>` selects how past-token state is kept:

- `standard` *(default)* — full FP32 K/V, unbounded. Shipped.
- `markov-bounded` — sliding window (StreamingLLM-style). Shipped.
  Pass `--context-window N` for the window size. Older tokens drop
  off; memory stays O(window) regardless of generation length.
- `none` — re-run full forward per decode step. O(N²). Shipped as
  correctness fallback.

Not yet wired into the live decode path (all in `crates/kv-cache-benchmark/`):

- `markov-full` — active residual window + cold-tier reconstruction
  via checkpoint layers. Compressed storage via residuals not K/V.
  See `crates/kv-cache-benchmark/src/markov_residual/`. Needs a
  reconstruction primitive that rehydrates K/V for cold-tier
  positions from `token_ids + checkpoint_residual`.
- `turboquant` — per-tensor Q4/Q8 compression of cached K/V. See
  `crates/kv-cache-benchmark/src/turboquant/`. Needs per-step
  quantize/dequantize around the cache append.
- `graph-walk` — experimental, unclear production viability.

### Shader attention + remote FFN

### Metal speedup for non-Q4K decode

**Status:** backend is auto-detected and threaded through
`generate_cached_backend`, but in practice **single-token decode
matmuls stay on CPU** because they fall below the Metal backend's
calibrated FLOP threshold (~500M). Per-layer projections on 4B are
only 5-7M FLOP each — far under the break-even point where GPU
dispatch overhead is worth paying.

**What this means today:**
- `larql run` on f16/f32 vindexes uses CPU BLAS projections regardless
  of `--metal` availability. The KV cache is still the decisive win
  (~6× speedup vs no-cache).
- `larql run --metal` on a **Q4K vindex** routes to
  `larql_inference::layer_graph::generate` (the shader
  `full_pipeline_q4` — all layers fused in one command buffer, KV-
  cached decode on GPU). This is the real GPU path.

**What would actually win on f16/f32:**
1. **Fused f16 full_pipeline shader** — same structure as Q4K's
   `full_pipeline` but with f16 weights. Multi-day shader work.
2. **Batched / speculative decode** — emit N tokens per forward pass
   (draft model, Medusa heads, or speculative sampling). N×M FLOP
   per matmul would clear the threshold. Compatible with remote FFN
   if the batching happens client-side.

See `crates/larql-compute/benches/{linalg,matmul}.rs` and the
many `crates/larql-compute/examples/profile_*.rs` for the measured
GPU-vs-CPU break-even curves — the threshold isn't arbitrary.

### Shader attention + remote FFN (Act 2 endgame)

Q4K + Metal + remote FFN — the ultimate Act 2 configuration. The
shader pipeline (`full_pipeline_q4` / `decode_token`) currently
dispatches attention AND FFN as fused GPU kernels reading from the
Q4K mmap. For remote FFN we'd need to decompose per-layer into:
attention-only GPU kernel → copy residual to host → HTTP round trip
→ copy FFN output back to GPU → next layer's attention. Per-layer
host+network hop kills throughput unless we batch across layers or
use async pipelining.

Worth doing for the Act 2 demo but non-trivial. See
`larql-inference/src/layer_graph/{generate,pipeline_layer,prefill}.rs`
— the fused paths need splitting at the attention/FFN seam.

## P1 — Loose ends in shipped features

### `--compact` loader reconstruction — WalkFfn-only today

`larql extract --compact` drops `up_weights.bin` + `down_weights.bin`
from the extract. `WalkFfn` (the production inference path) works fine
— it reads feature-major `{up,down}_features.bin` directly. The dense
ground-truth path (`WeightFfn`, used by `larql dev walk --compare` for
validation) panics with a clear message.

**Why deferred.** The naive fix is to reconstitute
`Array2<f32>` tensors in `ModelWeights.tensors` at load time. For
`down_proj` this requires a transpose (feature-major `[intermediate,
hidden]` → safetensors `[hidden, intermediate]`) which means an owned
copy — **~27 GB of extra heap on 31B**, not viable.

**Proper fix.** Refactor `WeightFfn::forward` (or `ModelWeights`) to
accept feature-major views and pass the transpose flag through to BLAS
gemm. Cross-cutting change: `crates/larql-inference/src/ffn/weight.rs`,
`crates/larql-inference/src/model.rs`, and the `dot_proj` helpers. ~1
focused session.

**Impact.** Unblocks `--compact --compare` for validation workflows.
Does not affect `larql run` or the demo.

### MoE compact mode — refused today

`larql extract --compact` on an MoE architecture refuses with:
> *"ffn_compact not yet supported for MoE architectures — per-expert
> feature-major files don't exist yet"*

**Why deferred.** Two blockers:

1. **Router lives in `up_weights.bin`.** The MoE write path stuffs
   per-expert up weights *and* the router matrix together into
   `up_weights.bin`. Skipping that file loses the router, so the model
   can't dispatch to experts at all. Fix: split the router into its
   own file (`router_weights.bin` already exists as the intended home
   — see `crates/larql-vindex/src/index/router.rs`).
2. **No per-expert feature-major files.** `up_features.bin` /
   `down_features.bin` are single-matrix-per-layer. MoE-compact would
   need per-expert equivalents (~N× the file count or a new layout),
   plus a tool that produces them. No consumer exists yet.

**When to do it.** Pairs naturally with Phase 1 (MoE inference path)
and Phase 2 (per-expert server endpoint). Building those requires a
per-expert-addressable storage layout anyway; compact-MoE falls out of
it.

### `larql dev walk --compact` compatibility

`larql dev walk --compare` against a `--compact` vindex panics (see
above). The panic message points at `WalkFfn` but doesn't explain
`--compare` is the specific operation that's blocked. Improve the
error or disable the `--compare` flag at arg-parse time when the
target vindex is compact.

### Cross-vindex dedup (tokenizer, down_meta)

Tokenizer (~32 MB) and `down_meta.bin` (~30 MB) are identical across
different-precision extracts of the same base model. With ~7 linked
vindexes in the local cache that's ~200 MB of duplicate data. Low
priority — worth doing as a content-addressed store if the cache
grows, otherwise skip.

---

## P2 — Demo production

### Pre-film checklist for the Gemma 4 MoE video

- [ ] Confirm Gemma 4 26B A4B config once the model card is public:
  expert count per layer, top-K, exact active-param figure, GQA ratio.
  Every `~` figure in `docs/demo-script-gemma4-moe.md` needs a real
  number before recording.
- [ ] Measure real footprint + latency on `google/gemma-4-31b-it` for
  Act 1. Replace every `~` in the Act 1 section.
- [ ] Reliability pass on `RemoteWalkBackend` (timeouts, retries,
  mid-layer failure, partial shard outage). A hung HTTP call during
  recording kills the take.
- [ ] `RemoteExpertBackend` (doesn't exist yet — see Phase 2) same
  pass.
- [ ] Decide the repo-public date. `cargo install larql-cli && larql
  serve` should be live the week the video drops so "you can do this
  too" lands with a working command.
- [ ] Pick expert IDs for the Video 3 teaser swap — one that fires on
  medical prompts, one that doesn't — so the "replace expert 42 at
  layer 18" shot lands concretely.

### Memory-footprint `--ffn-only` on the server

`larql serve --ffn-only` today is an operating-mode declaration — it
disables `/v1/infer`, advertises `mode: ffn-service` in `/v1/stats`,
but still loads full `ModelWeights` into RAM. A real FFN-service
doesn't need attention weights resident.

Add `load_model_weights_ffn_only` to `larql-vindex` that skips
attention tensors on the server side. Payoff: serve an MoE without
the attention weights taking a third of RAM.

---

## Done (ship log)

### CLI redesign (primary / dev split)
- New verbs: `run`, `chat`, `pull`, `list`, `show`, `rm`, `link`.
- Research commands moved under `larql dev <subcmd>`; legacy names
  transparently trampolined.
- Dual cache (HuggingFace hub + `~/.cache/larql/local/`) with
  shorthand resolution and source disambiguation.
- `larql serve --ffn-only` flag propagated through CLI → server →
  `/v1/stats`.

### Phase 0 — dense remote FFN baseline
- `POST /v1/walk-ffn` extended with `full_output: true` +
  `seq_len: N`. Server runs the architecture-correct `WalkFfn`,
  returns `[seq_len × hidden]` row-major.
- gRPC mirror (`WalkFfnRequest` / `WalkFfnLayerResult` proto fields).
- `RemoteWalkBackend` in `larql-inference` implements `FfnBackend`,
  slots into `predict_with_ffn` unchanged.
- `larql run --ffn URL` + `larql dev walk --ffn-remote URL` CLI flags.
- `examples/remote_walk_parity.rs` localhost parity probe.

### Vindex size reductions
- `--quant q4k` defaults gate_vectors + embeddings to f16 (previously
  f32 — silent ~32% bloat on every q4k extract).
- `--compact` skips `up_weights.bin` + `down_weights.bin` (saves 3.4
  GB on 4B f16 / ~14 GB proportionally on 31B non-Q4K).
- `--drop-gate-vectors` skips `gate_vectors.bin` on Q4K extracts;
  loader reconstructs from `interleaved_q4k.bin` at load time. 2.3 s
  on 4B / ~12 s on 31B cost, saves 1.7 GB / 13.9 GB respectively.
  Measured via `crates/larql-vindex/examples/bench_gate_dequant.rs`.

### Decoupled-inference memory asymmetry (real, pre-load filtered)
- `LoadWeightsOptions { skip_attn, skip_ffn, skip_lm_head, skip_embed }`
  filters weight manifest entries before mmap+decode — peak RSS
  reflects only what the caller wanted (no allocator-pooling lie).
- Server `--ffn-only`: skips attn + ffn + lm_head + embed at load.
  Walk-ffn endpoint uses `walk_ffn_full_mmap` which reads
  feature-major mmap, not heap tensors.
- Client `--ffn URL`: skips FFN tensors at load. Attention + embed +
  norms + lm_head only on heap.
- Measured on Gemma 3 4B f32 (`gemma3-4b-v2.vindex`):
  - Server RSS: 12.8 GB idle → **12.8 GB through inference** (never grew)
  - Client load: 22.5 s → **7.9 s** (2.8× faster)
  - Forward pass: 3.83 s → **0.83 s** (4.6× faster — no FFN tensor
    touches on the client)
  - Paris @ 80.66% — bit-identical to local unlimited-K walk
- Drop-post-load helpers (`ModelWeights::drop_{attn,ffn,lm_head,embed}_weights`)
  still exist but Rust's system allocator pools freed memory —
  post-load drops reduce heap accounting but not process RSS.
  Superseded by the pre-load filter for the demo path.
- `larql serve` now resolves cache shorthands (`larql serve gemma4-31b-q4k`
  works, not just full paths) via the same `cache::resolve_model`
  logic `larql run` uses.
- `larql run` / `larql dev walk` default `--top-k` to `usize::MAX`
  (unlimited). The old `top-k=10` default silently produced garbage
  on stale/low-K vindexes; removing the cap matches the server's
  `WalkFfn::new_unlimited` behavior.

### Extract tiers + default flip
- New `ExtractLevel::Attention` tier sits between `Browse` and
  `Inference`: includes attention + norms but not FFN. This is the
  first-class way to carve a client-side vindex for the Act 2 demo
  (`larql extract <model> --level attention`). No more ad-hoc slicing.
- Strict `Browse < Attention < Inference < All` ordering + helper
  methods (`writes_attn()` / `writes_ffn()` / `writes_lm_head()`)
  drive what each tier writes. Writers now actually honor the
  boundaries — previously only Browse was meaningfully different from
  non-Browse.
- **Default flip.** `larql extract` now defaults to `--level inference`
  + f16. The common case (`larql extract <model> -o x.vindex`) produces
  an inference-ready vindex out of the box, no flags needed. `--f32`
  opts out of f16 for the rare case someone wants it.

### Gemma 4 config plumbing
- Fixed three missing `final_logit_softcapping` initializers
  (pre-existing compile break on the `architecture-b` branch).
- Dropped an unused `mut` on a closure binding in
  `format/weights/write.rs`.

### Test coverage
- **490 tests across 14 suites**, zero warnings.
- New: cache resolution (19), argv trampoline (8),
  `RemoteWalkBackend` wire format + config + error shape (10), server
  validation + stats mode advertisement (7), local-cache scan
  end-to-end.

## Non-goals

- **Not a general model-serving framework.** LARQL's pitch is "the
  model is the database"; inference is a vehicle for the interpretable
  vindex, not the product. We optimize for composability, editability,
  and the demo narrative — not raw throughput against vLLM/TensorRT.
- **Not a training system.** `COMPILE` writes into weights; that's
  patch-level edits, not gradient descent. Stays out of scope.
- **Not HF-compatible on the output side.** We extract *from* HF
  models but the vindex format is our own. A vindex is not meant to be
  loadable by `transformers.AutoModel`.
