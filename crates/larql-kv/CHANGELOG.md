# Changelog — larql-kv

All notable changes to `larql-kv` are documented here.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) conventions
with dated entries (`YYYY-MM-DD`) instead of semantic versions during the
pre-1.0 phase. Forward-looking work lives in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md).

## [2026-05-10] — Coverage push

Total line coverage **67.44 % → 85.13 %** (+17.69 pp, 217 tests, +66 vs
extraction-day). 15 of 21 source files now at ≥ 90 %; the remaining 6
all carry tightened debt baselines.

| File | Before | After |
|---|---:|---:|
| `profiler.rs` | 0.00 % | 100.00 % |
| `engines/apollo/npy.rs` | 58.20 % | 93.61 % |
| `engines/apollo/engine.rs` | 71.98 % | 96.31 % |
| `engines/apollo/store.rs` | 17.81 % | 89.78 % |
| `engines/markov_residual/engine.rs` | 72.02 % | 93.23 % |
| `engines/markov_residual/q4k.rs` | 0.00 % | 57.14 % |
| `lib.rs` | 84.79 % | 90.03 % |

Notable additions:

- 8 `profiler` tests covering `StageAccumulator`, `EngineProfiler`, and
  `DecodeStageSummary` (including the `print()` smoke test for both the
  recompute-tier-present and total-zero branches).
- 4 `compliance_tests` lifting the default `KvEngine::prefill_q4k` /
  `decode_step_q4k` trait-method fallbacks via a synthetic
  `DefaultMethodsEngine` fixture.
- 5 `markov_residual::engine` tests covering profiling on/off split, the
  `with_profiling` setter, and the Q4K CPU fallback (Metal returns
  `None` → `rs_prefill_walk` / `rs_decode_step_walk`).
- 22 `apollo::npy` tests covering all `NpyError` variants, structured
  vs simple dtype dispatch, header field-parser branches.
- 13 `apollo::store` tests including end-to-end `ApolloStore::load`
  against a synthetic on-disk store built with `tempfile` + handwritten
  `.npy`/`.npz` fixtures.
- 11 `apollo::engine` tests including KvEngine `prefill` / `decode_step`
  for both compressed (boundary residual) and uncompressed paths,
  `query_greedy` smoke test, and `store()` getter.

### Warnings cleanup

Same day: removed 3 unused-import warnings in
`kv-cache-benchmark/src/real_model/{decode_comparison,runner}.rs`,
reverted a `kv_dim.is_multiple_of(hd)` clippy-fix in
`turbo_quant/engine.rs` (1.87.0 stable, MSRV 1.80), and reordered
`apollo/engine.rs` so the `KvEngine` impl precedes the test module
(satisfies clippy's `items-after-test-module`). `cargo clippy -p
larql-kv --all-targets` is now clean.
## [2026-05-09] — Initial extraction from larql-inference

Genesis commit. The crate was carved out of
`larql-inference/src/engines/` (~5,540 LOC) where the four KV engines and
the supporting trait/dispatch had grown into a self-contained subsystem
with a real second consumer (`kv-cache-benchmark`) already importing it
through compatibility shims.

### Moved into larql-kv

| Component | Origin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `KvEngine` trait, `EngineKind`, `EngineInfo` | `engines/mod.rs` | Now the crate root. |
| `accuracy` module | `engines/accuracy.rs` | `softmax` re-exported from `larql_inference::forward::softmax` instead of being internal. |
| `profiler` module | `engines/profiler.rs` | Verbatim. |
| `engines::apollo` | `engines/kv_engines/apollo/` | Drop the redundant `kv_engines/` middle path. |
| `engines::markov_residual` | `engines/kv_engines/markov_residual/` | |
| `engines::turbo_quant` | `engines/kv_engines/turbo_quant/` | |
| `engines::unlimited_context` | `engines/kv_engines/unlimited_context/` | |

All `crate::{attention,ffn,forward,layer_graph,model,residual,vindex}::*`
paths inside the moved code rewritten to `larql_inference::*`.

### Stayed in larql-inference

- `engines::test_utils` — relocated to `larql_inference::test_utils`. ~20
  internal tests across `attention/`, `forward/`, `ffn/`, `layer_graph/`,
  `trace/`, `vindex/walk_ffn/` use these synthetic-weight fixtures and
  cannot follow into a downstream crate without a circular dep.

### Public-API surface widened in larql-inference

- `DEFAULT_GPU_KV_CACHE_MAX_SEQ` lifted from `pub(crate)` to `pub` in
  `layer_graph::pipeline_layer` so engines can read it from the new home.

### Removed re-exports from `larql_inference::*`

The following used to be at the `larql_inference` crate root or in
`research::*` and now live in `larql-kv`:

- `EngineInfo`, `EngineKind`, `KvEngine`
- `MarkovResidualEngine`, `UnlimitedContextEngine`
- `compare_hidden`, `cosine_similarity`, `js_divergence`, `kl_divergence`,
  `mse`, `softmax`, `HiddenAccuracy`

Downstream consumers should add `larql-kv` to their Cargo.toml and import
from there.

### Consumer updates

- `larql-cli` — `bench_cmd.rs` now imports `EngineKind` and
  `kv_memory_bytes_for_seq` from `larql_kv`. Workspace metal feature gained
  `larql-kv/metal`.
- `kv-cache-benchmark` — compat shims (`apollo/`, `turboquant/`,
  `unlimited_context/`, `real_model/markov_layer.rs`) now re-export from
  `larql_kv` directly. README updated.
- `larql-inference` examples — `apollo_rd_backend.rs` imports from
  `larql_kv::apollo`; `mech_interp_demo.rs` uses
  `larql_inference::test_utils`.

### kv-cache-benchmark cleanup

After the extraction landed, `crates/kv-cache-benchmark/src/apollo/` still
contained five orphan `.rs` files (`engine.rs`, `store.rs`, `routing.rs`,
`entry.rs`, `npy.rs`) — pre-extraction copies that the `mod.rs` re-export
shim didn't reference but had been kept around. Two `#[ignore]`'d
`real-model`-feature demo tests (`tests/test_apollo_query.rs`,
`tests/test_apollo_accuracy.rs`) called four demo helpers that lived only
in the orphan `engine.rs` (`query_greedy_with_tokenizer`,
`query_greedy_compressed`, `query_generate_compressed`,
`query_generate_uncompressed`); the test build was failing on
`--features real-model` as a result.

All seven files were deleted as part of this cleanup. The
`apollo-demo/apollo11_store` end-to-end harness can be reconstructed from
git history if needed; the underlying functionality (routing, entry
retrieval, boundary-residual injection) is exercised by the surviving
larql-kv apollo unit tests plus the `kv-cache-benchmark` criterion bench.

### Coverage at extraction

After running `cargo llvm-cov --package larql-kv` plus `profiler.rs` test
top-up, total line coverage was **69.82 %** (2 838 / 4 065 lines, 143 unit
tests + 8 new profiler tests). 10 inherited files sat below the 90 %
per-file floor and carried baselines in `coverage-policy.json` that may
only ratchet upward. See [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) for the remediation
list. `make larql-kv-coverage-policy` enforces the baselines.

### Rationale

The four engines collectively share a trait and dispatch but diverge on
state management. Keeping them inside `larql-inference` meant every change
to a single engine recompiled the whole inference crate (transformer
forward pass, mech-interp surface, layer graphs). They are also the
target of independent benchmarking — the `kv-cache-benchmark` crate already
treated them as separable. Splitting tightens the API contract between
"transformer forward" (larql-inference) and "KV state strategy" (larql-kv).

The cut was clean: every primitive engines depend on (`ModelWeights`,
`BackendFfn`, `WalkFfn`, `KvCache`, `forward_*`, `rms_norm_heads`, …) was
already public in larql-inference, so this extraction did not require
designing new API.
