//! Accuracy test suite — the five tests that prove the video frame.
//!
//! Test 1: Paris test (pass/fail sanity across all 5 strategies)
//! Test 2: Top-1 match rate on 100 diverse prompts
//! Test 3: KL divergence on full output distribution
//! Test 4: Multi-token generation stability (50 tokens, first diverge)
//! Test 5: Needle-in-a-haystack at scaling context lengths
//!
//! Requires `real-model` feature — needs actual model weights.
