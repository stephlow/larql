# Roadmap — larql-server / larql-router

## Current state (as of 2026-04-26)

- Code quality pass complete: modularity refactor + magic string cleanup + test restructure (see Completed below).
- Follow-up review fixes complete: rate limiting no longer trusts
  `X-Forwarded-For` by default, route/path strings are centralized,
  server loader options are grouped, embed errors use the standard JSON
  error envelope, and server-local clippy allows were reduced.
- Test coverage: **74.2% line / 81.2% function** (478 tests, 0 failures). gRPC handler tests unblocked grpc.rs (0%→65%); focused unit coverage raised `embed_store.rs` to 98% line, `announce.rs` to 56%, `bootstrap.rs` function coverage to 92%, `routes/stream.rs` to 65%, `routes/embed.rs` to 87%, and `routes/walk_ffn.rs` to 80%.
- Server-local clippy is clean with
  `cargo clippy -p larql-server --tests --no-deps -- -D warnings`.
  The dependency-checking form still stops in `larql-vindex`; that is
  tracked outside this server-only pass.
- Examples and synthetic benchmarks checked on 2026-04-26:
  `server_demo`, `embed_demo`, `server_bench --release`, and
  `cargo check -p larql-server --examples` all pass. `bench_embed_server`
  builds with examples but requires a real vindex path to execute.
- Grid route-table checks are now covered by `cargo test -p larql-router`
  (20 tests, including 7 grid-state tests) plus server announce-envelope tests.
- 2-shard local grid validated end-to-end on Gemma 4 26B-A4B (30 layers,
  inclusive layer ranges 0-14 + 15-29).
- W2 feature-major down retrofittable in-place via
  `larql convert add-feature-major-down --input <vindex>` (1.12 s for
  30 layers, 152 MB output).
- Live W2 surface on `GET /v1/stats.q4k_ffn`:
  `{cache_slots, cache_bytes, feature_major_down}`.
- `--warmup-hnsw` flag eager-builds HNSW across owned layers at boot
  (~325 ms for 15-layer shards on Gemma 26B).
- Grid memory profile (per-shard, single-machine): **9.1 GB RSS**,
  6.7 GB MALLOC_LARGE (gate f32 cache), `down_features_q4k.bin`
  resident at 0 K (capability, not yet exercised on dense path).

## Live perf snapshot (M3 Max, 2-shard grid, 26B-A4B)

### Dense walk-ffn / gate-KNN path

| Operation | Cold | Warm |
|---|---|---|
| `walk-ffn` 1 layer (router) | 12.8 ms | **0.2–0.3 ms** |
| `walk-ffn` 6 layers fanout | — | **1.3 ms** |
| `walk-ffn` 12 layers fanout | 64 ms | 2.6 ms |
| `walk-ffn` 24 layers fanout | 75 ms | 5.0 ms |
| `walk-ffn` 30 layers (full) | 30 ms | **5.9 ms** |
| `walk` (gate KNN, 30L) | — | 8.4 ms |
| 8-way concurrent × 15L fan-out | 112 ms wall | ~1070 layer-evals/sec |

P99 under 8-way contention: 24 ms.

### Remote MoE expert path (Gemma 4 26B-A4B, single in-process shard, layer 15, top-K=8)

`bench_expert_server` against per-layer Q4_K vindex (post `experts_packed.bin`
removal). Hidden=2816, 128 experts, moe_intermediate=704, 30 MoE layers.

| Operation | Result |
|---|---|
| Vindex load | 4.6 s, +6.0 GB RSS |
| Lazy `get_or_load_weights()` | 1.2 s, +2.9 GB RSS |
| Per-expert bytes (one bench layer, all 128) | 285 MB gate_up + 156 MB down (Q4_K) |
| `forward_moe` warm (router + batched HTTP + combine) | **1.91 ms** mean / 1.91 p50 / 2.43 p99 |
| `cpu_moe_forward` floor (no HTTP, same weights) | **0.10 ms** mean (LRU-warm Q4_K decode) |
| 30-layer sweep (1 decode-step's worth of MoE blocks) | **56.0 ms** (1.87 ms/layer) |
| Steady RSS | **9.7 GB** |

For comparison, before the per-expert refactor + Q4_K migration the same bench
on the BF16 monolith was 4.86 ms `forward_moe` warm, 28.9 ms/layer cold-page
sweep, and 16.6 GB steady RSS — i.e. the change cut latency 2.5× and RSS 1.7×.

### T3. Review follow-up — server hygiene ✅ done 2026-04-26

**Scope**: follow-up from review of `larql-server` focused on magic strings,
modularity, cleanliness, tests, and clippy.

Shipped:
- `X-Forwarded-For` is ignored by default for rate limiting; new
  `--trust-forwarded-for` opt-in is for deployments behind a trusted proxy.
- HTTP protocol constants added for shared health path, API prefix,
  bearer prefix, and binary FFN content type.
- Route path literals in `routes/mod.rs` centralized as named constants so
  single-model and multi-model routing drift is easier to spot.
- `load_single_vindex` now takes a `LoadVindexOptions` struct instead of
  an 11-argument call and repeated `too_many_arguments` clippy allows.
- Embed endpoints now return the standard `{"error": ...}` JSON envelope
  for errors instead of a mix of plain text and JSON.
- Server-local clippy cleanup removed the repeated `too_many_arguments`
  exemptions from the vindex loading path.

Follow-up worth keeping open:
- Consider a route-registration macro/table if route count keeps growing.

### T1. Test coverage — functional tokenizer + uncovered routes ✅ done 2026-04-26

**Outcome**: 49.1% → **58.0% line**, 56.4% → **65.3% function**. 345 → 402 tests.

**Root cause fixed**: added `functional_tokenizer()` (WordLevel, France→0 etc.) to
`tests/common/mod.rs`. The empty BPE tokenizer that previously blocked all
tokenize-dependent routes is now supplemented by a real in-memory tokenizer that
maps test words to embeddings with known KNN hits.

**Files moved:**

| File | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| `band_utils.rs` | 35% | **100%** |
| `routes/describe.rs` | 48% | **95%** |
| `routes/walk.rs` | 38% | **96%** |
| `ratelimit.rs` | 70% | **98%** |
| `routes/walk_ffn.rs` | 54% | **77%** |
| `routes/patches.rs` | 63% | **91%** |
| `routes/relations.rs` | 83% | **91%** |

**Remaining hard ceiling** (no path forward without real weights or real sockets):

| File | Coverage | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `grpc.rs` | 0% | Needs full gRPC server+client; defer |
| `routes/stream.rs` | 0% | WebSocket — needs `tokio-tungstenite`; defer |
| `routes/explain.rs` | 11% | Calls `get_or_load_weights()`; rest gated on real model |
| `embed_store.rs` | 25% | Reads real f16 embedding files |
| `main.rs` | 0% | CLI entrypoint; skip |

### T2. Test coverage — remaining reachable paths ✅ done 2026-04-26

**Current**: 74.2% line / 81.2% function. 478 tests.

**Completed this pass:**
- `grpc.rs` 0% → **65%** — 28 direct gRPC handler tests (health, stats, describe, walk, select, relations, walk_ffn, infer, stream_describe)
- Magic strings: `"probe"` → `PROBE_RELATION_SOURCE`; `"ok"` → `HEALTH_STATUS_OK`; infer mode strings in grpc.rs; WebSocket message types in stream.rs (`WS_TYPE_*`, `WS_CMD_*`)
- `embed_store.rs` 25% → **98% line** — tiny f16 mmap fixtures cover open, size validation, lookup, L1 cap, out-of-range, subnormal/inf/nan conversion.
- `announce.rs` 6% → **56% line** — extracted deterministic message builders for announce, heartbeat, dropping, and grid bearer metadata.
- `main.rs` boot/loading/discovery helpers moved into `bootstrap.rs`; `bootstrap.rs` has **92% function** coverage for parse/discovery/serve-alias/options behavior.
- `routes/stream.rs` 0% → **65% line** — WebSocket JSON message builders plus pure describe-message planning cover missing-entity, no-model, and functional edge streaming cases.
- `routes/infer.rs` 32% → **56% line** and `routes/explain.rs` 18% → **46% line** via request/default deserialization tests and response-formatting helpers.
- `routes/embed.rs` 67% → **87% line** — binary embed/logits parsing extracted into helpers; HTTP tests cover binary success, malformed JSON, truncated binary input, hidden-size mismatches, no-model errors, and cacheable single-token JSON/binary responses.
- `routes/walk_ffn.rs` 77% → **80% line** — validation helpers now cover layer selection precedence, missing layers, seq_len handling, overflow, and latency rounding.

**Remaining hard ceiling:**

| File | Current | Gap | What to add |
|---|---|---|---|
| `main.rs` | 0% | 237 lines | Tokio binary entrypoint; boot orchestration is covered through `bootstrap.rs` |
| `bootstrap.rs` | 43% | 134 lines | Real vindex load path still requires filesystem fixtures with full vindex assets |
| `routes/stream.rs` | 65% | 148 lines | Full WebSocket socket loop still needs a client harness such as `tokio-tungstenite` |
| `routes/explain.rs` | 46% | 167 lines | Main path gated on `get_or_load_weights()` and real inference trace |
| `routes/infer.rs` | 56% | 82 lines | Prediction paths need real or injectable inference backend |
| `routes/embed.rs` | 87% | 74 lines | Remaining positive logits path requires loadable weights/lm_head fixture |
| `routes/walk_ffn.rs` | 80% | 125 lines | Remaining full-output path requires loadable weights/FFN fixture |
| `routes/warmup.rs` | 80% | ~15 lines | `warmup_hnsw=true` warn path (HNSW not enabled) |
| `announce.rs` | 56% | ~78 lines | Remaining gap is live gRPC stream lifecycle and retry loop |

### G1. Cold-start profile ✅ done 2026-04-26
**Findings**: walk-ffn cold cost decomposes into two distinct phases:

1. **First walk-ffn ever**: ~1.27 s + ~2.9 GB RSS — lazy
   `get_or_load_weights` builds the f32-decoded gate-vector cache,
   loads `lm_head.bin` + `norms.bin`. One-shot regardless of which
   layer was requested. Confirmed not Metal init: a prior gate-KNN
   walk only adds 2 MB.
2. **First touch of each new layer**: ~17 ms + ~11 MB RSS — kernel
   page-fault for the layer's `interleaved_q4k.bin` slice (gate +
   up + down, ~22 MB on disk). Linear in number of cold layers.

Warm steady state is **0.2–0.3 ms/layer**. The 50× cold:warm ratio
is mostly phase 1; phase 2 is ~50× cheaper.

Conclusion: the win lives in phase 1 — pre-load weights at boot.
Mmap prefetch is a 12 ms one-shot for all 30 layers (negligible).
Both wired in **G2** below.

### G2. `/v1/warmup` endpoint + `--warmup-walk-ffn` flag ✅ done 2026-04-26
**Impact (measured on Gemma 26B)**: first walk-ffn **1247 ms → 12.6 ms (99×)** at the cost of +3.2 GB pre-allocated RSS and ~1.3 s boot delay.

Shipped:
- `POST /v1/warmup` accepting `{layers, skip_weights, warmup_hnsw}`
  (all optional). Returns `{weights_loaded, weights_load_ms,
  layers_prefetched, prefetch_ms, hnsw_built, hnsw_warmup_ms,
  total_ms}`.
- `larql-server --warmup-walk-ffn` boot flag — calls the same code
  path before the listener binds. Goes through
  `warmup_model_async` (`spawn_blocking`) because the boot point
  is already inside the tokio runtime.
- The endpoint runs the work on a blocking pool so the runtime
  stays responsive.

### G3. Dual-host gRPC self-assembling grid ✅ done 2026-04-26
**Live-validated** (single-host two-port simulation, exercises the
same code path as a real LAN-distributed grid):

- Shards launched with `--join http://router:50052 --grid-key <s>
  --public-url http://shard:port` register automatically; router
  logs `Grid: server joined layers=0-14` and updates coverage.
- `total_layers_covered` field on the router is the operator's
  view of grid completeness.
- Killed shard A → router logs `Grid: server left`, coverage drops.
  Layer-5 request returns HTTP 400 `"layer 5 has no owning shard"`
  (clean error, not hang). Layer 22 (live shard B) stays at 0.3 ms.
- Restart killed shard → it auto-rejoins, coverage returns to 30,
  layer 5 routes successfully (cold-page first request: 13.9 ms).
- README "Recommended setup" updated with the `--grid-port` /
  `--join` recipe (separate edit pending).

The gRPC mechanism is production-ready as of this validation.
True cross-host RTT measurement is forward-looking (G3a below).

### G3a. Cross-host RTT measurement *(forward-looking)*
**Status**: open. Requires two physical machines on the same LAN.
The same-host validation establishes correctness; cross-host
measures the additional TCP overhead per fan-out.

## P2: Forward-looking

### G4. mmap residency control endpoint
**Impact**: For long-running shards under memory pressure, expose
`POST /v1/mmap/advise {layers, advice: "willneed"|"dontneed"}` so
operators can trim RSS or pre-warm specific layer ranges without
restarting.

### G5. Per-shard expert routing
**Impact**: For DeepSeek-V3+/Kimi K-class models (1k+ experts), shard
by expert ID within a layer rather than by layer range. Needs an
`ExpertRoute` message type in `larql-router-protocol` and
GridState dispatch updates. Mentioned in larql-vindex P2.

### G6. Live router-shard topology change
**Impact**: Today shards are static (`--shards` flag at router boot).
For ops convenience, expose `POST /v1/router/shards` (admin-gated)
to add/remove a shard without restarting the router. Pair with
`--grid-port` health checks.

## Completed

### 2026-04-26 — Per-expert byte table refactor + `experts_packed.bin` removal

`MoeLayerWeights.experts_{gate_up,down}` migrated from `&[u8]` (monolith +
`expert_idx * stride` arithmetic in the compute path) to `Vec<&[u8]>`
(per-expert slice table). The CPU MoE consumer (`cpu_moe_forward` and
`run_single_expert{,_with_norm}`) now indexes by expert id directly, with
format dispatch (BF16 vs Q4_K) at the cache layer.

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `larql-compute` | `cpu/ops/moe/{cache,expert,forward,mod}.rs` and `pipeline.rs::MoeLayerWeights`. `cached_dequant(bytes, format, expected_floats)` dispatches BF16/Q4_K. `expert_byte_slice` deleted. Tests updated. 94/94 pass. |
| `larql-vindex` | `cpu/ops/q4_common.rs::dequantize_q4_k` lifted to module scope so the compute crate can dequant Q4_K without a `larql-models` dependency. |
| `larql-inference` | `build_moe_weights` builds per-expert tables from either `weights.get_layer_entry_bytes(...)` (per-layer Q4_K) or BF16 stride slicing (legacy). `QuantFormat` re-exported. |
| `larql-server` | `routes/expert.rs::run_expert` resolves per-expert bytes through whichever path the vindex provides; honours `expert_filter` ownership. `tests/test_expert_endpoint.rs` updated to slice synthetic monoliths into per-expert tables. 4/4 parity tests pass. |
| 26B-A4B vindex | `weight_manifest.json` stripped of `packed_bf16` rows for experts (60 → 421 entries). `experts_packed.bin` deleted (43 GB freed; vindex 58 → 16 GB). |
| Bench parity | `bench_expert_server` re-runs end-to-end against the per-layer-only vindex. `forward_moe` warm latency unchanged at 1.91 ms (was 1.93 ms when monolith was still on disk). 30-layer sweep at 56 ms (cold-page sweep on BF16 monolith was 866 ms). |

`bench_expert_server` and the parity tests both detect the format
automatically (`weights.has_per_layer_ffn()`); legacy BF16 vindexes still work
unchanged. Future MoE vindexes only emit per-layer files — the q4k extractor
at `format/weights/write_q4k/mod.rs` already does this.

### 2026-04-26 — examples, synthetic benchmark, grid checks

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `server_demo` | Runs locally with synthetic data; fixed invalid probe-label JSON comma output and updated rate-limit text for `--trust-forwarded-for`. |
| `embed_demo` | Runs locally with synthetic embed/logits/token responses and binary-wire examples. |
| `server_bench --release` | Synthetic benchmark completed: `gate_knn` top-5 0.022 ms/op, 8-layer `walk` 0.203 ms/op, single-layer `walk-ffn` 0.032 ms/op, batched 8-layer `walk-ffn` 0.321 ms/op, describe simulation 0.298 ms/op, 512-token embed prefill 0.114 ms/op. |
| `bench_embed_server` | Example builds under `cargo check -p larql-server --examples`; execution requires a real vindex path. |
| Grid unit coverage | Added `GridState` tests for inclusive ranges, default single-model routing, least-loaded replica selection, deregistration, batched gap reporting, and status gaps. `cargo test -p larql-router` now runs 20 tests. |
| Docs | Updated server README examples/benchmarks/testing, router README validation, and router spec validation commands. |

### 2026-04-26 — coverage round-6 (embed + walk-ffn reachable gaps)

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `routes/embed.rs` modularity | Extracted binary embed/logits parse helpers and binary embed response encoder |
| `routes/embed.rs` coverage | **66.7% → 86.5% line**, **70.7% → 86.3% function** |
| `routes/walk_ffn.rs` coverage | **76.7% → 79.5% line**, **77.3% → 82.0% function** |
| Tests | 458 → **478** tests |

### 2026-04-26 — modularity + coverage round-5

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Boot/loading modularity | Moved parse/discovery/vindex-load helpers out of `main.rs` into `bootstrap.rs`; binary now keeps CLI orchestration while library code is directly testable |
| `routes/stream.rs` | Extracted pure `stream_describe_messages`; describe stream behavior can be tested without a WebSocket client |
| `routes/infer.rs` | Extracted mode selection and prediction formatting helpers |
| `routes/explain.rs` | Extracted band mapping, probability/gate/attention rounding, prediction formatting, and lens formatting helpers |
| Clippy | Server-local clippy clean with `--no-deps`; full dependency-checking command is blocked by existing `larql-vindex` warnings |
| Coverage | **69.2% → 71.9% line**, **77.1% → 78.9% function** (458 tests) |

### 2026-04-26 — coverage round-4 (T2 reachable gaps)

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `embed_store.rs` | 25% → **98% line** with tiny f16 mmap fixtures and L1 cache behavior tests |
| `announce.rs` | 6% → **56% line** by extracting/test-covering announce, heartbeat, dropping, and bearer helpers |
| `main.rs` | 0% → **23% line** with binary unit tests for parse/discovery/serve-alias helpers |
| `routes/stream.rs` | 0% → **28% line** with pure WebSocket message shape builders |
| `routes/infer.rs`, `routes/explain.rs` | Default/request deserialization coverage added; full paths remain weight-gated |
| Coverage | 63.9% → **69.2% line**, 73.4% → **77.1% function** (430 → 458 tests) |

### 2026-04-26 — coverage round-3 (T2 partial) + magic strings round-2

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `test_grpc.rs` — 28 new gRPC handler tests | Direct method calls on `VindexGrpcService` — no network socket; health, stats, describe, walk, select, relations, walk_ffn, infer, stream_describe |
| `grpc.rs` coverage | 0% → **65%** (169 lines uncovered, all gated on real model weights or gRPC streaming) |
| Magic strings — `"probe"` | `PROBE_RELATION_SOURCE` constant in `band_utils.rs`; used in describe.rs, grpc.rs, stream.rs |
| Magic strings — `"ok"` | `HEALTH_STATUS_OK` constant; used in grpc.rs health handler |
| Magic strings — gRPC modes | `INFER_MODE_WALK/DENSE/COMPARE` applied to grpc.rs (was using bare strings) |
| Magic strings — WebSocket types | `WS_TYPE_ERROR/LAYER/DONE/PREDICTION/INFER_DONE` and `WS_CMD_DESCRIBE/INFER` in stream.rs |
| Coverage | 57.2% → **63.3% line**, 65.3% → **73.2% function** (402 → 430 tests) |

### 2026-04-26 — coverage round-2 (T1)

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `functional_tokenizer()` in common | WordLevel tokenizer (France→0, …) added to test infra; unblocks describe/walk/walk-ffn body paths |
| `test_http_full_routes.rs` | 39 new HTTP integration tests exercising full describe/walk/walk-ffn code paths |
| `test_unit_band_utils.rs` | 13 pure unit tests for `band_utils.rs` constants + helpers |
| Infer + ratelimit branches | `infer_disabled=false` model builder; ratelimit middleware axum tests |
| Coverage | 49.1% → **58.0% line**, 56.4% → **65.3% function** (345 → 402 tests) |

### 2026-04-26 — code quality round-1

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Modularity — deduplicate `session_id()` | 3 identical private fn definitions → 1 `pub fn extract_session_id` in `session.rs` |
| Modularity — `get_layer_bands()` / `filter_layers_by_band()` | 5 / 3 duplicated blocks → `src/band_utils.rs` |
| Modularity — `model_or_err()` | 25 repeated `ok_or_else(NotFound)` sites → `AppState::model_or_err()` |
| Modularity — `elapsed_ms()` | 20 repeated latency-rounding expressions → `src/state::elapsed_ms()` |
| Magic strings — band names | `"syntax"/"knowledge"/"output"/"all"` → `BAND_*` constants in `band_utils.rs` |
| Magic strings — infer modes | `"walk"/"dense"/"compare"` → `INFER_MODE_*` constants |
| Magic strings — insert modes | `"constellation"/"embedding"` → `INSERT_MODE_*` constants |
| Magic strings — patch names | `"unnamed"/"inline-patch"` → `PATCH_UNNAMED`/`PATCH_INLINE_NAME` constants |
| Magic strings — HTTP headers | `"x-session-id"` → `HEADER_SESSION_ID`; `"etag"/"cache-control"/"if-none-match"` → axum `header::*` |
| Test restructure | `test_api.rs` (2600 L) + `test_http.rs` (1400 L) → 10 focused files (100–350 L each) + `tests/common/mod.rs` |
| Coverage baseline | 39.7% → **49.1% line**, 41.6% → **56.4% function** (345 tests, 0 failures) |

### 2026-04-26 — perf round-1 (G1+G2+G3)

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| G1 cold-start profile | Two-phase: 1.27 s lazy weight load + 17 ms/layer mmap page-in. Warm steady state 0.2–0.3 ms/layer. |
| G2 `/v1/warmup` + `--warmup-walk-ffn` | First walk-ffn 1247 ms → 12.6 ms (99×). Boot trades ~1.3 s + 3.2 GB pre-allocation. HTTP endpoint also exposed for live re-warm. |
| G3 self-assembling gRPC grid | Live-validated `--grid-port` + `--join`: auto-join, coverage tracking, graceful failure (clean HTTP 400 on uncovered layer), auto-recovery on rejoin. |

### 2026-04-26 — W2 retrofit + grid validation

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| `--warmup-hnsw` flag | Eager-builds HNSW across owned layers at boot via `warmup_hnsw_all_layers()`. Reports correct owned-layer count under `--layers`. |
| Boot log: W2 status | `Down features Q4K: loaded (W2 — per-feature decode skips q4k_ffn_layer cache)` when `down_features_q4k.bin` is present. |
| `/v1/stats.q4k_ffn` field | `{cache_slots, cache_bytes, feature_major_down}` — operators can verify W2 active + cache empty in steady state. |
| `larql convert add-feature-major-down` | New CLI subcommand. Retrofits an existing Q4K vindex without re-quantising the rest. 30 layers / 152 MB / 1.12 s on Gemma 26B. Idempotent. |
| Live grid validation | 2-shard layer-range split (0-14 + 15-29) on real 26B vindex, full fan-out via router, 8-way concurrent stress, 0.2 ms warm per-layer, 5.9 ms full-30-layer fan-out. |

### Pre-2026-04-26 — foundations (already in place)

- HTTP API: `/v1/walk`, `/v1/walk-ffn`, `/v1/stats`, `/v1/health`,
  `/v1/infer`, `/v1/insert`, `/v1/expert/{layer}/{id}`, etc.
- `--layers START-END` shard slicing (mmap pages outside range stay
  paged out, RSS proportional to shard size).
- `--max-q4k-cache-layers` LRU bound on the legacy Q4K dequant cache.
- `--ffn-only` / `--embed-only` mode flags.
- gRPC self-assembling grid (`--grid-port` / `--join` / `--grid-key`).
- Bench rig daemon-aware (`larql-vindex` benches refuse if a server
  shares the host; override with `LARQL_BENCH_ALLOW_DAEMONS=1`).
