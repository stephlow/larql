//! Optimized mmap helpers for vindex file loading.
//!
//! Two access patterns:
//! - `mmap_optimized`: MADV_SEQUENTIAL + MADV_WILLNEED — for files that must
//!   be fully resident (embeddings, norms, attn weights). Prefaults pages at
//!   load time so the first query doesn't stall on page faults.
//! - `mmap_demand_paged`: MADV_RANDOM — for large sparse files (gate vectors,
//!   feature payloads). Pages fault in only when accessed, keeping RSS low at
//!   load time. Gate KNN touches all pages during a linear scan but only a
//!   logarithmic subset when HNSW is active.

/// Create an mmap with SEQUENTIAL + WILLNEED hints — prefaults all pages.
///
/// Use for files that will be read fully on every forward pass (embeddings,
/// norms, attention weights). Not suitable for large sparse files where only
/// a fraction of pages are touched per token.
///
/// # Safety
///
/// The caller must ensure the file is not modified or truncated while the
/// mmap is alive.

/// Use for large sparse files (gate_vectors.bin, interleaved_q4k.bin) where
