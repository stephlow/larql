//! `VindexStorage` — sealed mmap-agnostic byte-handle trait.
//!
//! Goal: every backend (today's mmap; eventual Redis-cached, S3-buffered,
//! GPU-resident) satisfies the same surface. Walk kernels, Metal
//! dispatch, and KNN consume this trait — they don't reach into
//! `Arc<Mmap>` fields directly.
//!
//! ## Status
//!
//! Step 1 of the migration plan in `ROADMAP.md` (P0 active, promoted
//! from P2 on 2026-05-10): trait skeleton only, no impls, no callsite
//! changes. The `MmapStorage` parity wrapper lands in step 2; the
//! Criterion bench gate lands in step 3 before any substore migration.
//!
//! ## Returns: `BytesView<'a>` (per-layer) and `Bytes` (whole-file)
//!
//! Per-layer accessors return `BytesView<'a>` — a borrowed
//! `(&'a Bytes, offset, length)` triple. `as_slice() -> &'a [u8]` is
//! zero atomics (just pointer arithmetic into the parent `Bytes`);
//! `to_owned() -> Bytes` is opt-in for callers that need the
//! refcounted handle (Redis emit, cross-thread shipment). The hot
//! path — walk kernels and Metal dispatch — never pays a refcount
//! bump per layer fetch.
//!
//! Whole-file accessors (`*_whole_buffer`, `lm_head_*`) return
//! `bytes::Bytes` directly — they're fetched once at load time, not
//! per-layer-per-token, so the one-time `Bytes::clone` is invisible.
//!
//! Why not `&[u8]` everywhere? Locks remote backends out: a Redis
//! impl has owned bytes that can't anchor on the substore. By keeping
//! the *whole-file* view as `Bytes` (which can be `Bytes::from_owner`
//! over an mmap or `Bytes::copy_from_slice` over a Redis buffer) and
//! exposing per-layer cuts via `BytesView` borrowing from that
//! `Bytes`, both backends fit. The cost on the mmap side is one
//! `Bytes` per substore field at construction, which is paid once.
//!
//! Why not `Cow<'_, [u8]>`? Same lifetime story but no `to_owned`
//! escape hatch — callers that need to keep bytes alive past the
//! borrow have no clean upgrade path.
//!
//! ## Sealing
//!
//! Sealed via the standard private supertrait pattern: out-of-crate
//! types cannot implement `VindexStorage`. We need this so we can add
//! methods (with defaults) without a major bump as Redis / S3 backends
//! arrive. The cost is that downstream tests can't write a stub impl —
//! acceptable here because the capability traits
//! (`QuantizedFfnAccess`, `NativeFfnAccess`, `Fp4FfnAccess`) already
//! cover the dispatch logic above this layer with their own stubs.
//!
//! ## Method shape
//!
//! Every byte-yielding method returns `Option<...>`. `None` means
//! "this backend doesn't carry that file kind" (e.g., FP4 vindexes
//! don't have Q4_K FFN data; client-only slices have no gate
//! vectors). Callers must treat absence as a fall-through, not an
//! error.
//!
//! ## Out of scope (for now)
//!
//! `Fp4Storage` and `DownMetaMmap` are deliberately not behind this
//! trait. Both carry richer per-feature decoders (FP4/FP8 dequant
//! tables, per-layer offsets + tokenizer for down_meta) that are not
//! a clean fit for the "give me bytes" surface. They keep their own
//! mmap fields on substores and stay reachable as
//! `Arc<Fp4Storage>` / `Arc<DownMetaMmap>` directly. If a Redis-backed
//! FP4 vindex ever lands, the path is to either provide a parallel
//! `Fp4Storage` impl or have `Fp4Storage` consume `VindexStorage`
//! internally — but that's a separate decision from this trait.
