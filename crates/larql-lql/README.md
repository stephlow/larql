# larql-lql

The LQL parser, executor, and REPL — SQL-like queries against vindexes.

## What is LQL?

LQL (LARQL Query Language) is a query language for vindexes. It looks like
SQL but operates on a transformer's weight matrices: you `EXTRACT` a model
into a vindex, `WALK`/`DESCRIBE`/`SELECT` to interrogate it, `INSERT`/
`DELETE`/`UPDATE` to edit knowledge through the patch overlay, and
`COMPILE` back to safetensors / GGUF when you're done.

```rust
use larql_lql::{Session, parse, run_repl};

let mut session = Session::new();
let stmt = parse(r#"USE "gemma3-4b.vindex";"#)?;
session.execute(&stmt)?;

let stmt = parse(r#"INFER "The capital of France is" TOP 5;"#)?;
let lines = session.execute(&stmt)?;
for line in &lines { println!("{line}"); }
```

The same `Session::execute` path drives the REPL (`larql repl`), the
vindexfile build executor, and the in-process embedding (Python bindings,
larql-server).

## Statement families

| Family | Statements | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| **Lifecycle** | `EXTRACT`, `COMPILE`, `DIFF`, `USE` | vindex / model |
| **Query** | `WALK`, `INFER`, `SELECT`, `DESCRIBE`, `EXPLAIN` | vindex (model weights for INFER) |
| **Mutation** | `INSERT`, `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE` | patch overlay (base files never modified) |
| **Patch** | `BEGIN PATCH`, `SAVE PATCH`, `APPLY PATCH`, `SHOW PATCHES`, `REMOVE PATCH` | patch session |
| **Trace** | `TRACE`, `EXPLAIN INFER` | full forward pass with attribution |
| **Introspection** | `SHOW {RELATIONS, LAYERS, FEATURES, MODELS, PATCHES}`, `STATS` | metadata |
| **Pipe** | `<stmt> \|> <stmt>` | composition |

The full grammar is in `docs/lql-spec.md`. The user-facing tutorial is in
`docs/lql-guide.md`.

## INSERT and the multi-layer constellation

`INSERT INTO EDGES` installs a multi-layer constellation by default — the
validated regime from `docs/training-free-insert.md` (8 layers × `alpha=0.25`).
Single-layer installs at this alpha don't move the logits enough; raising
alpha breaks neighbouring facts. There is no single-layer mode.

```sql
-- Default form: spans the upper half of the knowledge band.
INSERT INTO EDGES (entity, relation, target)
    VALUES ("Atlantis", "capital-of", "Poseidon");

-- Centered on a specific layer (8-layer span around L24, clamped to
-- valid range), with explicit confidence and alpha override.
INSERT INTO EDGES (entity, relation, target)
    VALUES ("Atlantis", "capital-of", "Poseidon")
    AT LAYER 24
    CONFIDENCE 0.95
    ALPHA 0.30;
```

The three optional clauses are independent and can be combined:

| Clause | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `AT LAYER N` | upper half of knowledge band | Centers the 8-layer constellation span on layer N |
| `CONFIDENCE c` | 0.9 | Stored on the inserted features |
| `ALPHA a` | 0.25 | Per-layer down-vector scale (validated range ~0.10–0.50) |

## COMPILE INTO VINDEX

`COMPILE CURRENT INTO VINDEX "out.vindex"` produces a real standalone vindex
with the inserted facts baked into the canonical `down_weights.bin`. No
sidecar, no overlay, no special loader code — `USE "out.vindex"` and
`INFER` works like any other vindex.

End-to-end on Gemma 4B:

```
INSERT Atlantis → Poseidon         (8 layers × alpha=0.25)
COMPILE CURRENT INTO VINDEX "out.vindex"
USE "out.vindex"
INFER "The capital of Atlantis is"  → Pose 56.91% ✓
INFER "The capital of France is"   → Paris 67.34% ✓ (preserved)
```

The constellation is sitting in the canonical `down_weights.bin` columns,
which is exactly what `weight_manifest.json` references. A subsequent
`COMPILE INTO MODEL FORMAT safetensors` exports those bytes verbatim, so
loading the result in HuggingFace Transformers gives you the inserted
facts via standard `model.generate()` — no special loader code.

`COMPILE INTO VINDEX` accepts three optional clauses, in any order:

```sql
COMPILE CURRENT INTO VINDEX "out.vindex"
    ON CONFLICT FAIL
    WITH REFINE
    WITH DECOYS ("To be or not to be", "Water is a");
```

**`ON CONFLICT`** — how to resolve slots written by more than one patch.

| Strategy | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `LAST_WINS` (default) | Last applied patch wins. |
| `HIGHEST_CONFIDENCE` | Accepted for forward compatibility. Currently resolves like `LAST_WINS` for down vectors — see spec §3.5. |
| `FAIL` | Abort if any slot has a conflicting write. |

**`WITH REFINE | WITHOUT REFINE`** — whether the bake step orthogonalises
each patched gate against the other patched gates at the same layer
before writing the canonical files. `INSERT` is intentionally a dumb
append (no model weights required), so refine runs once at compile time
when the full constellation is in hand. Default is `WITH REFINE`. Use
`WITHOUT REFINE` for tests, benches, or when you want byte-identical
output to a hand-built patch.

**`WITH DECOYS (<prompt>, ...)`** — supplies prompts that are
forward-passed at compile time; their residuals at the install layer
become extra suppression vectors in the refine pass. Use this to defend
specific bleed targets that the constellation alone cannot reach
(semantic associations like Hamlet→Shakespeare on `"To be or not to be"`).
Validated end-to-end in `experiments/14_vindex_compilation` —
constellation refine + decoys gives 10/10 retrieval and zero regression
bleed; constellation refine alone leaves 1-2 semantic bleeds out of 4
on a 10-fact Gemma 3 4B constellation.

> **Status:** end-to-end on synthetic vindexes. The refine primitive
> (`larql-vindex::patch::refine`), decoy capture entry point
> (`larql-inference::capture_decoy_residuals`), and executor wiring all
> live in `main` and are unit-tested. Production validation against a
> real Gemma 3 4B vindex (matching `experiments/14_vindex_compilation`'s
> 10/10 retrieval, 0/4 regression bleed) is the next step. See spec §11.6.

The full mechanism is documented in `docs/vindex-operations-spec.md` §1.6.

## Building & Testing

```bash
cargo test -p larql-lql                                       # 267 tests
cargo test -p larql-lql --lib executor::tests                 # executor mutation pipeline
cargo test -p larql-lql --lib parser::tests                   # parser unit tests

# Demos
cargo run -p larql-lql --example parser_demo                   # AST output, every statement type
cargo run -p larql-lql --example lql_demo                      # 56-row spec compliance grid
cargo run --release -p larql-lql --example compile_demo        # End-to-end COMPILE INTO VINDEX
cargo run --release -p larql-lql --example refine_demo         # End-to-end refine + decoys (exp 14 reproduction)
                                                                #   on real Gemma 4B (skips if absent)

# Criterion benches (use --quick for a fast sweep)
cargo bench  -p larql-lql --bench parser                       # parse_single × 18, parse_batch
cargo bench  -p larql-lql --bench executor                     # SELECT, SHOW, DELETE, UPDATE, patch lifecycle
cargo bench  -p larql-lql --bench compile                      # COMPILE INTO VINDEX bake cost + refine vs no-refine
```

### Test coverage (267 tests)

- **Parser** (`parser/tests.rs`, 1,500+ lines): every statement type and
  every clause combination, plus negative tests for malformed input.
- **Executor — no-backend errors**: every statement type returns
  `LqlError::NoBackend` cleanly when no `USE` has run.
- **Executor — Weight backend**: `USE MODEL` path with synthetic weights,
  validates which statements work without a vindex.
- **Executor — mutation pipeline**: builds a synthetic vindex on disk,
  runs `USE` against it, exercises `DELETE`, `UPDATE`, `BEGIN PATCH`,
  `SAVE PATCH`, auto-patch lifecycle, and `MERGE` error paths.
- **`COMPILE INTO VINDEX` byte baker**: 6 unit tests for `patch_down_weights`
  covering f32/f16 dtypes, multiple-feature/multiple-layer overrides,
  shape mismatch errors, and missing-source error paths.

### Bench measurements (typical machine)

| Bench | Operation | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `parser` | parse `STATS;` | **102 ns** |
| `parser` | parse 100-statement batch | **78 µs** (1.28 M stmts/s) |
| `executor` | `SELECT * FROM EDGES LIMIT 5;` | 425 ns |
| `executor` | `STATS;` | 19 µs |
| `executor` | `DELETE … WHERE layer/feature` (USE+DELETE) | 98 µs |
| `executor` | `BEGIN PATCH → DELETE → SAVE PATCH` | 136 µs |
| `compile` | `COMPILE INTO VINDEX` (no patches) | **1.84 ms** |
| `compile` | `COMPILE INTO VINDEX` (with `down_weights.bin`) | **2.41 ms** |

Run `cargo bench -p larql-lql` (without `--quick`) for the full criterion
sample sizes — HTML reports go to `target/criterion/`.
