//! Shared helpers for the per-kernel test files in this directory.

//! Each top-level `.rs` file under `tests/` is its own test binary in
//! Cargo's model, so they can't share state at the module level. The
//! standard idiom is `#[path = "common/mod.rs"] mod common;` in each
//! test file, which inlines this module's contents into that binary.
//! Helpers are `#[allow(dead_code)]` because no single binary uses
