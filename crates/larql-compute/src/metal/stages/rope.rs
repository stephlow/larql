//! Rotary position embedding (RoPE) — pre-attention when KV cache is used.
//!
//! Applies RoPE to Q and K in-place per head per position. Supports
//! partial rotation (Gemma 4 global layers use `rotary_dim = head_dim / 4`).
//!
//! The shader dispatched is `rope_at_pos` which rotates a single head's
//! `rotary_dim / 2` pairs. We loop per position, per head, dispatching
//! a thread per pair. One encoder batches all dispatches for efficiency.
