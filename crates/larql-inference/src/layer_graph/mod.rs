//! LayerGraph — pluggable per-layer routing for attention and FFN.
//!
//! The transformer layer loop receives a residual, routes through attention
//! and FFN, and produces the next residual. The mechanism behind each step
//! can vary:
//!
//! - Dense matmul (today's baseline)
//! - Walk/vindex (sparse FFN from mmap)
//! - Template cache (precomputed routing for known templates)
//! - Residual-adaptive graph (cluster-based routing)
//!
//! The `LayerGraph` trait abstracts this: given a residual, produce the
//! layer output. The implementation decides how attention and FFN are computed.
