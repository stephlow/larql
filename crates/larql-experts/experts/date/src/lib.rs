//! # Date expert
//!
//! Gregorian-calendar date arithmetic via Julian Day Number. Dates are encoded
//! as `{year: int, month: 1..=12, day: 1..=31}` objects.
//!
//! ## Ops
//!
//! - `days_between {from: date, to: date} → int`
//! - `weeks_between {from: date, to: date} → int`
//! - `day_of_week {date: date} → int` (ISO-8601: 1 = Monday, 7 = Sunday)
//! - `add_days {date: date, days: int} → date`
//! - `is_leap_year {year: int} → bool`
//! - `days_in_month {year: int, month: 1..=12} → int`
